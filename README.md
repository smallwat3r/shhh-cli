# Shhh-cli  

## What is it?  

**shhh-cli** is a Command Line Interface tool to interact with 
[Shhh](https://github.com/smallwat3r) web-application API.  
This tool allows you to create and read secrets directly from the 
command line / terminal.

## How to tell shhh-cli to generate secrets to your own Shhh server?  

shhh-cli interacts by default with the official Shhh server 
(shhh-encrypt.com). If you host Shhh on your own server, you can 
set-up an env variable `SHHH_SERVER`. It will know interact with 
your server as default.  

```sh
# Example (in you bashrc)
export SHHH_SERVER=https://shhh-encrypt.herokuapp.com
```

## How to install it?  

If you are a Go user:
```sh
go get -u github.com/smallwat3r/shhh-cli \
    && mv $GOPATH/bin/shhh-cli $GOPATH/bin/shhh
